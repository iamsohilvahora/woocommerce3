== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Knowledge Base =
You can find solutions and answers at the [ExpertRec Knowledge Base](https://blog.expertrec.com/knowledge-base/?utm_source=wordpress.org).

= What is my API Key? =
A common mistake is to think that your API key is the same as your email ID or web URL. API key is a unique identifier that you get when you make an account with ExpertRec. This key is used to identify and power your search. You can read more about getting your API key [here](https://blog.expertrec.com/how-to-get-your-expertrec-site-id/).

= Why is the search bar not appearing? =
1. Have you activated the Site Search plugin?
2. Is your API Key correct? [Get API key here](https://blog.expertrec.com/how-to-get-your-expertrec-site-id/?utm_source=wordpress.org).
3. Are you on a custom theme? Some themes may not have a search by default or may interfere with the plugin. In this case you may have to add code manually from [here](https://cse.expertrec.com/csedashboard/home/code?fr=wp_plugin).
4. [Contact Support](https://cloudinfra.freshdesk.com/support/tickets/new)

= Does the search bar support live search / ajax search? =
Yes, the ExpertRec site search plugin is a live search plugin and it will support AJAX search.

= Do I need an account to make a Custom Search Engine =
Yes, you will need to [sign up](https://cse.expertrec.com/?platform=wordpress) with ExpertRec to get your API key. Once you have this, you will be able to add the custom search engine to your website.

= Can I use this on my Woocommerce store? =
Yes, ExpertRec site search does support Woocommerce search. The steps for installation are exactly the same. The search bar will intelligently detect Woocommerce and make the neccessary changes to get a better search experience suited to eCommerce.

= Does it support voice search? =
Voice search is supported by the ExpertRec site search widget on Chrome browser. Support for Firefox is in beta and can be made available on request.

= Is voice search free to use? =
Voice search is entirely free to use. During the 14-day free trial you can test out the full capability of the search engine. After that, you can continue using the voice search along with the default Wordpress search. It is recommended that you take a paid plan for getting maximum performance.

= Can I search multiple websites or multiple subdomains using this plugin? =
Yes, you can do both. Using this plugin your search bar will give results from both your main domain and all subdomains. You can also selectively choose which of your subdomains should be included in the search results. If you wish to search a completely separate domain, then this can also be done by adding the new domain to the list of URLs to crawl. 

= Is there any addtional charges for searching multiple URLs? =
No, all charges are based on the total number of pages in the search index. There is no limit on the number of domains that you can add.
